List Comprehension (Opetional. Like Javascript )
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp
and check if substring is in string (You can do that!)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-string-contains-substring-in-python/

Divide the list based on '|' or ','

# Part 1 checkValid() loop explain:
Iterate each updateList and iterate each element in that list
If that element is equal to the 0 index of orderList (ex: "75"|53),
but the index (updateList) of the 1st index (orderList. ex: 75|"53") is less than current index (updateList)
or if orderList[j][1] is not found in row (why we use try-except block)

# Part 2
Same trick as part one but instead of returning True or False
It just swap value of the current Index with the wrongIndex 
And keep checking if the updated invalidsUpdate is valid or not in the while loop, else keep changing


orderList: [['47' | '53'], ['97' | '13'], ['97' | '61'],..., [75 | 53] ]
row: 75, 47, 61, 53, 29
